# 📘 JavaScript Logic Exercises

This project was created to practice and strengthen **core JavaScript logic skills**, progressing from basic control structures to more analytical problem-solving using arrays, objects, and functions.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

Develop strong foundations in:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Array manipulation
- Object manipulation
- Functions
- Logical reasoning applied to real-world scenarios

---

## 📂 Project Structure

index.html
src/
 └── assets/
      └── js/
           └── exercises.js


- `index.html` loads the script.
- All logic is implemented inside `exercises.js`.

# 🧠 Implemented Exercises

## 🔹 Logic Fundamentals

1. Positive or negative number check  
2. Even or odd verification  
3. Grade classification system  
4. Countdown using `while`  
5. Summation using `for`  
6. Menu system using `switch`

---

## 🔹 Array Manipulation

- Adding and removing elements (`push`, `shift`)
- Searching values (`includes`)
- Measuring length (`length`)
- Sorting arrays (`sort`)
- Filtering values using `filter`

---
